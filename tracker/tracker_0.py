"""
Code for particle tracking.  Meant to be fast and simple, but capable
of tracking backward in time.

Designed for ROMS output with plaid lat, lon grids.

Recoded the integration scheme around 7/15/2016 to use new version of
get_interpolant.py, and to better handle many particles.

Recoded this driver to split the run up into 1-day chunks, because of
memory issues inlarge runs.

PERFORMANCE: With the new fast version is took about 12 seconds
for a day of integration for 6-600 particles, and only increased to
19 seconds for 6000 particles.  The old slow version was faster
for < 100 particles, but otherwise became very slow, scaling linearly
with the number of particles.  These tests were all with the cascadia1 grid.

The design philosophy is that this should be capable of handling both
LiveOcean and older versions, like from PNWTOX, of how files are stored.
It should also work on different platforms (my mac and fjord at this time).

This program is mainly a DRIVER where you supply:
    - which run to work on
    - particle initial locations
    - a list of starting times
    - duration in days to track
    - forward or backward in time
    - some other flags
